# sOED-project
This is the GitHub repository for the code associated with the Dissertation on a Statistics Subject assessment at the University of Oxford. My candidate number is 1032935.

Code is made available in four different folders. Code in the 'main' folder is from https://github.com/wgshen/sOED. To run the contaminant source inversion experiment with no exploration noise, look at code in the "no_noise" folder.
The sPCE folder contains code to run the contaminant source inversion experiment using the sPCE lower bound as the reward function. Finally, the sPCE-loc_finding folder contains code to run the location finding experiment using the sPCe lower bound as the reward function.
